- The current window has syntax highlighting (inactive windows are greyed out).
  - I have LSP configured to provide additional information (e.g. see popup context window).
- The winbar displays the current LSP symbol structure (e.g. where is my cursor currently).
- Top of the buffer uses TreeSitter to show the current function.
  - This only shows when the function is so long the signature isn't visible to the buffer viewport.
- Right side of the main window is a 'mini map' of the file content (uses TreeSitter to add colour).
- The statusline bar displays:
  - Neovim current 'mode'
  - The current git branch
  - LSP diagnostics
  - Relative file path
  - File encoding
  - The filetype
  - The scroll percentage
  - The line:column
- Bottom window are LSP diagnostics.
- Left window is a file tree view of my project.
  - It's not normally that wide, I manually widened because I wanted to see the full path without scrolling.
- Top of the Neovim editor our tabs will display a filetype icon.
  - e.g. gopher icon for the `.go` file open in the screenshot.
- Neovim is running inside of the Zellij terminal emulator.
  - e.g. The two shell instances: "dotfiles", "terraform" can be seen at the top of the screenshot.
